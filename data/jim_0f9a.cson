	Hi Guys.
	Gift is for an activity I really hope.
	Something "exciting" and outdoors, could be a tandem skydive, the meanest roller coaster, snorkelling on the great Barrier reef. Whatever should have a little trepidation, definitely smiles and maybe some screaming.
	
	Really looking forward to the day.
	
	Lots and lots of luck!!!!
	My hugest smile and hugs.
	
	Jimmyc
